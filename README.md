# Arduino-Uno-R32-Esp32-Esp8266-LCD-3-sensors

This type of Arduino Uno has on board integrated Wifi and Ble. 
The LCD displays text on two lines. The measurements of sensors are displayed on an LCD I2C.
The weather like sensors indicate temperature & preasure, rain & the amount of drops & and the amount of light. 

Components: 
- Arduino Uno R32
- LCD display
- Three sensors
    1. Humidity / temperature
    2. Rain Sensor
    3. Photosensible sensor
- Connectors
- Power cable arduino

The experiments combine LCD with one or two sensors. It is possible to use all the sensors at once.
